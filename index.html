        <h2>Reading is the process of taking in the sense or meaning of letters, symbols, etc., especially by sight or touch.-Wikipedia </h2>
        <h4>The purpose of reading is to connect the ideas on the page to what you already know. If you don't know
            anything about a subject, then pouring words of text into your mind is like pouring water into your hand.
            You don't retain much. For example, try reading these numbers:
        <div>7516324 This is hard to read and remember.</div>
        <div>751-6324 This is easier because of chunking.</div>
        <div>123-4567 This is easy to read because of prior knowledge and structure.</div>
        Similarly, if you like sports, then reading the sports page is easy. You have a framework in your mind
        for reading, understanding and storing information.</h4>
